# language:

python. you can already see from the repo, but this was a laborious choice coupled with my unique circumstance and future goals. GPT5 deeply researched the matter for 7 minutes.

pros:
- syntax is easy
    - harder to bonk in interviews
- easy access to data structures, unlike typescript
- relates well to my longer term Machine Learning Engineer goals
